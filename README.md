Jira report writing 

In this jira procedure, we performed testing for aarong website. Here we found some bugs and fixed it later. After collecting bugs we assigned it to the developer. After the developer received the bugs, he started working on and the working state was in progress. After solving the bug developer ensures it by clicking the done. After that, as a tester I was checking and found the bug was solved and the working state was done. Then I performed the test again and ensured myself it was working accurately. In this way all the testing has been done and fixed all the bugs.
